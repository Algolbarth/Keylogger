# Keylogger

In order to get all keyboard inputs, I create a little app.
With python, we create a log file, which one can be read with a web interface (making with Svelte).

First time, run the python script. Now you can juste use your computer as u want. When you have finished, just stop the script.

Secondly, you can find a web interface in "public" folder. Next select and drop the log file.
You can visualise all inputs, with date details dans graphics.
